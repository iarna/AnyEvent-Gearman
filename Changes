      - melo++ did several fixes listed below
      - added the add_task_bg() API for background jobs;
      - a couple of fixes here and there:
      - the usage gearman_worker('127.0.0.1') or gearman_client('127.0.0.1')
        was failing with "modification of read-only value message";
      - Added missing dependencies: Test::Base and others. I wonder why you use Test::Base though, I don't think its maintained anymore, and the latest Test::More with the done_testing() API do most of what I liked on Test::Base;
      - fixed a bug in Worker where he would not grab a new job after being done with the first one;
      - a bit of cleanups in the test directory;
