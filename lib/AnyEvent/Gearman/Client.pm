=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::Gearman::Client - Gearman client for AnyEvent application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use AnyEvent::Gearman::Client;
    
    # create greaman client
    my $gearman = AnyEvent::Gearman::Client->new(
        job_servers => ['127.0.0.1', '192.168.0.1:123'],
    );
    
    # start job
    $gearman->add_task(
        $function => $workload,
        on_complete => sub {
            my $res = $_[1];
        },
        on_fail => sub {
            # job failed
        },
    );
    
    # start background job
    $gearman->add_task_bg(
        $function => $workload,
    );
    

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is Gearman client module for AnyEvent applications.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Gearman::Client::Async>, this module provides same functionality for L<Danga::Socket> applications.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(%options)

Create gearman client object.

    my $gearman = AnyEvent::Gearman::Client->new(
        job_servers => ['127.0.0.1', '192.168.0.1:123'],
    );

Available options are:

=over 4

=item job_servers => 'ArrayRef',

List of gearman servers. 'host:port' or just 'host' formats are allowed.
In latter case, gearman default port 4730 will be used.

You should set at least one job_server.

=back

=head2 add_task($function, $workload, %callbacks)

Start new job and wait results in C<%callbacks>

    $gearman->add_task(
        $function => $workload,
        on_complete => sub {
            my $result = $_[1],
        },
        on_fail => sub {
            # job failled
        },
    );

C<$function> is a worker function name, and C<$workload> is a data that will be passed to worker.

C<%callbacks> is set of callbacks called by job events. Available callbacks are:

=over 4

=item on_complete => $cb->($self, $result)

Called when the job is completed. C<$result> is some results data which is set by C<< $job->complete($result) >> in worker.

=item on_fail => $cb->($self, $reason)

Called when the job is failed. C<$reason> is empty if its threw by worker. I don't know why but gearman spec say so. Considering to use C<on_warning> below for some failing notify.

=item on_warning => $cb->($self, $warning)

Called when C<< $job->warning($warning) >> called in worker.

=item on_data => $cb->($self, $data)

Called when C<< $job->data($data) >> called in worker.

=item on_status => $cb->($self, $numerator, $denominator)

Called when C<< $job->status($numerator, $denominator) >> called in worker

=item on_created => $cb->($self)

Called when the servers reports that the task was created successfully.
Updates the Task object with the server assigned C<job_handle>.

=back

You should to set C<on_complete> and C<on_fail> at least.


=head2 add_task_bg($function, $workload, %callbacks)

Starts a new background job. The parameters are the same as
L<add_task($function, $workload, %callbacks)|add_task()>, but the only
callback that is called is C<on_created>.

    $gearman->add_task_bg(
        $function => $workload,
        on_created => sub {
            my ($task) = @_;
        },
    );
